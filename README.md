# Similarity API Benchmarks

This repository is the public home for all technical evaluations, experiments, and real-world demonstrations of **Similarity API**.

We use this space to openly publish reproducible benchmarks, accuracy studies, performance comparisons, and practical examples that showcase where Similarity API provides exceptional advantages over traditional approaches — including fuzzy matching libraries, embeddings-based similarity, custom dedupe pipelines, and rule-based systems.

Our philosophy is simple:

**Prove the value of Similarity API in the open, using transparent and repeatable code — not marketing claims.**

Every script in this repository is designed to be run as-is by any developer. You can validate the results yourself, plug in your own data, or adapt the examples directly into your own pipelines.

This repo will continue to grow.
